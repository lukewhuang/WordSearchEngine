# WordSearchEngine

In the first executable, you will be taking as input a word to be searched and also a threshold value for the count and you must output the list of files in which the word appears a minimum of (threshold) number of times. For example, given a word ‘cat’ and threshold 2, you must output the list of files in lexicographically increasing order in which the word ‘cat’ appears 2 or more times.
In the second executable, you will be taking as input 2 words, and you must output the union of the 2 lists of files in lexicographically increasing order in which either or both of the 2 words appear.
